# ARK32

Firmware for ARM-based brushless ESC (electronic speed controllers).

**ARK32** is a **fork of [upstream AM32](https://github.com/am32-firmware/AM32)** maintained by **[ARK Electronics](https://arkelectron.com/)**. It tracks upstream capability while carrying ARK’s product line, control-path work, and test infrastructure. (This repository was previously published as `ARK-Electronics/AM32`; that URL redirects here.)

## What ARK32 adds

### Commutation: BLHeli-style blind stepping, poll mode is startup-only

Upstream runs two commutation modes and switches between them at runtime: an interrupt-driven closed loop on the comparator zero-cross (ZC), and a slower polled ("old routine") mode that it falls back to whenever the average commutation interval gets long. On ARK targets that fallback was the failure mode — a single missed crossing under load dropped the loop back to poll mode, which is slower, so the average got worse, so it stayed there. Motors could sit in an OL↔CL oscillation instead of spooling.

ARK32 replaces the runtime mode switch with per-step extrapolation, the way BLHeli handles a missed crossing:

- **Missed-ZC deadline.** After each commutation, `COM_TIMER` is re-armed as a deadline for the *next* crossing — expected arrival plus 50% grace. An accepted crossing cancels it by re-arming the timer for the normal commutation schedule.
- **Blind step.** If the deadline fires first, the ESC commutates blind and takes the full elapsed time as the (late) interval measurement. The inflated sample pulls the running average toward *slower* timing — the safe direction for a decelerating rotor — and the next real crossing resyncs immediately. Blind steps do not count as zero crosses.
- **Bounded.** 8 consecutive blind steps means position is genuinely unknown: commutation stops and the existing `INTERVAL_TIMER` stall rail restarts the motor through the normal startup ramp.
- **No CL→OL exit at runtime.** Poll mode's enter thresholds are unchanged, but they now only apply during startup. Once the loop is on interrupts it stays there or restarts — it never degrades into polling.
- **Interrupt-ZC trust rail.** A closed loop can hold a *stable false lock*, tracking switching artifact edges below usable BEMF: crossings keep arriving on time, so neither the blind-step deadline nor the average-jump desync check can see anything wrong. If a closed loop's per-electrical-rev average stays above `polling_mode_changeover + 500` for 4 consecutive revs, it is treated as a desync and restarted through startup. The 4-rev gate keeps a lagging average during spool-up from tripping it.

Net effect: a missed crossing costs one extrapolated step instead of a mode change. In SITL, `racer_5inch` spools to ~13.7k rpm and holds, where the previous behavior bounced between open and closed loop around ~3k. Low-throttle crawl and throttle-chop behavior are unchanged.

Source: [`Src/bemf_zc.c`](Src/bemf_zc.c) (deadline, blind step, resync), [`Src/commutation.c`](Src/commutation.c) (mode entry), [`Src/runtime_loop.c`](Src/runtime_loop.c) (desync / trust rail).

### G431 COMP blanking (turn-on noise)

On **ARK 12S CAN** (STM32G4), TIM1 OC5 can blank the comparator output over the PWM turn-on transient. ST’s blanking **forces the output low** (it does not hold the last level), so it is only safe on **falling-BEMF** steps; rising-BEMF steps run ungated. Design note, Alka/ST semantics, knobs, and bench checks: [doc/g431-comp-blanking.md](doc/g431-comp-blanking.md).

### Global refactor
Large control-path split out of a monolithic `main.c` into focused modules (runtime, settings, motor control helpers, and related MCU/F051 work). The goal is safer changes, clearer ownership of hot paths, and room for instrumentation without growing one file forever.

### SITL (software-in-the-loop)
Native Linux build of the firmware against a simulated motor / bridge / battery, with DroneCAN over multicast UDP. Useful for protocol, startup, and logic tests without ESC hardware.

- Overview: [Mcu/SITL/README.md](Mcu/SITL/README.md)
- CI: `.github/workflows/SITL.yml`

```bash
make arm_sdk_install   # once, for cross toolchain (SITL itself is host gcc)
make AM32_SITL_CAN
obj/AM32_AM32_SITL_CAN_*.elf --node-id 10 --verbose
```

### HITL / Hardware-CI
In-the-loop bench automation for the **ARK 4IN1** (and related F051 work): build/flash, drive the motor (Flight Stand and/or PX4 BDShot setups), read on-device performance counters over SWD, and produce metrics / pass-fail reports.

- Harness: [hwci/README.md](hwci/README.md)
- Bench setups: [hwci/docs/BENCH_SETUPS.md](hwci/docs/BENCH_SETUPS.md)
- CI: `.github/workflows/hwci.yml`

### Bootloader
Field bootloaders and app-side BL update use **[ARK32-bootloader](https://github.com/ARK-Electronics/ARK32-bootloader)** (see [Bootloader](#bootloader) below and [Bootloaders/README.md](Bootloaders/README.md)).

## Branch model

| Branch | Role |
|--------|------|
| **`ark-release`** | ARK integration line — open product PRs here |
| `main` | Mirrors / tracks upstream AM32 more closely |
| Feature branches | Short-lived; rebase onto `ark-release` unless targeting pure upstream work |

---

## Build (make + GCC)

IDE project trees (Keil / MRS) are **not** maintained in ARK32. Use the Makefile and the pinned **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** (see `make/tools.mk`).

```bash
# Install the pinned xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC 15 into tools/<os>/
# (required — distro gcc-arm-none-eabi is not used for firmware builds)
make arm_sdk_install
make arm_sdk_check          # optional: confirm GCC 15.x at the pin path

# List / build targets (examples)
make targets
make -j$(nproc) ARK_4IN1_F051

# Production full-flash image (bootloader + app + factory EEPROM defaults)
make factory-image
# -> obj/AM32_ARK_4IN1_F051_<ver>.factory.bin  (flash at 0x08000000)
make factory-image-check   # same + layout/defaults gate (CI)
```

Firmware objects land under `obj/`. MCU families supported by the build system include F051, F031, G071, E230, F415, F421, L431, G431, V203, G031, A153, and SITL — exact product names live in `Inc/targets.h`.

### Production release image (ARK 4IN1)

Do **not** hand-assemble production firmware (flash BL → flash app → configurator EEPROM → ST-Link dump). Build the full 32 KiB image from the repo:

```bash
make factory-image
```

That links the release app, then runs [`scripts/build_factory_image.py`](scripts/build_factory_image.py) to lay out:

| Region | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Bootloader @ `0x08000000` | [`Bootloaders/`](Bootloaders/) ARK32-bootloader image |
| Application @ `0x08001000` | `make ARK_4IN1_F051` |
| EEPROM @ `0x08007C00` | [`factory/ARK_4IN1_F051_eeprom_defaults.json`](factory/ARK_4IN1_F051_eeprom_defaults.json) |

Ship/program `obj/AM32_ARK_4IN1_F051_*.factory.bin` (or `.factory.hex`). Defaults (PWM-by-RPM, 1020 kV, 2 %/ms ramp, 15° fixed advance, PWM min/max 1020/1980 µs) are documented in [`factory/README.md`](factory/README.md).

Optional static analysis / size / format helpers:

```bash
make format            # apply clang-format (.clang-format) to app + MCU sources
make check_format      # fail if sources need formatting (used in PR CI)
make format_changed    # format only files changed vs origin/ark-release
make cppcheck          # static analysis of the ARK F051 control path
make size-check-ark    # ARK F051 flash/RAM gate (HWCI+embed worst case, then release)
```

Style is **PX4-inspired** via clang-format (Linux braces, tab indent width 8, `int *p`, column 140) — same `make format` / `check_format` workflow as PX4, not astyle itself. See `.clang-format`.

`make format` skips vendor trees (`Mcu/**/Drivers`, CMSIS, DroneCAN `dsdl_generated` / `libcanard`). Install clang-format with `pip install --user 'clang-format==22.1.5'` (version pinned to match CI) or your distro package.

## Motor beeps and sounds

An ESC has no speaker. Beeps are PWM on the motor phases so the windings act as a small transducer (same idea as other BLHeli-family ESCs). Implementation: [`Src/sounds.c`](Src/sounds.c) / [`Inc/sounds.h`](Inc/sounds.h). Volume is EEPROM `beep_volume` (0–11; DroneCAN param `BEEP_VOLUME`, default 5). Sounds only run when the motor is **not spinning** (idle / disarmed / zero throttle as applicable).

Pitch below is **relative** (higher PWM timer prescaler → lower pitch). Exact Hz depends on MCU clock and timer setup. The ARK signature tunes (startup and arm/beacon-4 morse) instead use fixed note frequencies via `playBJNote`.

### Quick reference

| When you hear it | Pattern (pitch) | Function | Meaning |
|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Power-up (brushless) | Morse **“ARK”** (·– / ·–· / –·–) rising C6 → E6 → G6 (or custom melody) | `playStartupTune` | Firmware booted and is ready for input |
| Power-up (brushed build) | 4 rising beeps | `playBrushedStartupTune` | Brushed-mode startup |
| Signal lost (after soft-reset) | Single short low blip on C5 (~70 ms) | `playSignalLostTone` | RC/input timeout; distinct from the ARK boot tune |
| Arm / throttle zero accepted | Morse **“R”** (·–·) on G6 | `playInputTune` | ESC armed / input lock-in (“roger”) |
| Arm + cell LVC enabled | That “R” **once per cell** | `playInputTune` × N | Detected pack cell count (`Vbat / 3.70`) |
| Stick cal entered (PWM) | Descending whoop/sweep | `playBeaconTune3` | Entered servo high/low calibration |
| Stick cal high done | 2 notes, **rising** | `playDefaultTone` | Max endpoint captured |
| Stick cal low done | 2 notes, **falling** | `playChangedTone` | Min endpoint saved to EEPROM |
| DShot beacon 1 or 5 | Same as “default” 2-note rising | `playDefaultTone` | Beacon / locate |
| DShot beacon 2 | 2 notes, **falling** | `playChangedTone` | Beacon |
| DShot beacon 3 | Descending sweep | `playBeaconTune3` | Beacon |
| DShot beacon 4 | Morse **“R”** (·–·) on E6 | `playInputTune2` | Beacon |
| DShot cmd 12 (save settings) | Rising if normal dir, falling if reversed | `playDefaultTone` / `playChangedTone` | Settings written |

### Startup

| Function | When | Pattern |
|----------|------|---------|
| **`playStartupTune`** | Normal brushless boot (after init; also CRSF path) | If the previous run soft-reset from an RC **signal timeout**, plays **`playSignalLostTone`** instead (see below). Else if the previous run finished an app-side **bootloader update**, plays **`playBootloaderUpdatedTone`** then continues. Else if EEPROM custom tune byte 0 is programmed (not `0xFF`): plays **BlueJay-compatible** melody from `eepromBuffer.tune[]` via `playBlueJayTune`. Otherwise default: the **ARK signature tune** — “ARK” in morse code (·– / ·–· / –·–), one letter per step up a C major arpeggio (C6 → E6 → G6), ~1.4 s total. |
| **`playSignalLostTone`** | Soft-reset after armed (~0.5 s) or disarmed (~2 s) input timeout (`faultPollSignalTimeout` → `NVIC_SystemReset`) | **One short low blip** on C5 (≈ 523 Hz, ~70 ms). Marked via a `.noinit` cookie before reset so cold boot still plays the full ARK tune. Linker `.noinit` is provided for **F051** and **G431** (gcc + Keil G431 scatter). |
| **`playBootloaderUpdatedTone`** | Next boot after a successful app-side bootloader rewrite (`maybe_update_bootloader` → `bootSoundMarkBootloaderUpdated` → reset) | **Two rising beeps** E6 → G6 (~90 ms + ~140 ms). Then the normal ARK/BlueJay startup continues. Cookie in `.noinit` so cold power-on never false-triggers. |
| **`playBrushedStartupTune`** | `BRUSHED_MODE` builds only | **Four rising beeps** (~300 ms), phases 1–4 (prescalers 40 → 30 → 25 → 20). |
| **`playBlueJayTune`** | Custom startup only | Notes/rests encoded in EEPROM tune blob (configurator “custom startup music”). Inter-note pause can scale with tune header byte 3. |

Some AT32 F415 targets defer startup audio through `play_tone_flag` instead of calling the tune immediately at boot.

### Armed / input recognition

Played from the 20 kHz control path when the ESC transitions to armed-idle after a stable zero throttle (`Src/control_loop.c`).

| Function | When | Pattern |
|----------|------|---------|
| **`playInputTune`** | Armed with **low-voltage cutoff mode 1** (cell-based) **off**, or as each cell beep | **Morse “R”** (·–·, “roger — signal received”) on G6 (≈ 1568 Hz), ~320 ms (same busy-wait budget as the old tune). |
| **Cell-count beeps** | Armed **and** `low_voltage_cut_off == 1` | `cell_count = battery_voltage / 370` (≈ 3.70 V/cell), then **`playInputTune` once per cell** with ~100 ms gaps. Count the “R”s to read pack cell count. |
| **`playInputTune2`** | DShot beacon 4; also used as deferred arm beep on some AT415 builds | Same **morse “R”** one arpeggio step lower (E6, ≈ 1319 Hz) so the beacon is distinguishable from the arm tune. |

### Servo PWM stick calibration

Only for **servo PWM** input when stick calibration is not disabled. Sequence in `Src/signal.c`:

1. Hold **high stick** long enough → **`playBeaconTune3`** (descending multi-step whoop) — calibration mode entered.
2. Hold steady **max** until accepted → **`playDefaultTone`** (two notes, **rising**: lower then higher).
3. Move to **min** and hold until accepted → **`playChangedTone`** (two notes, **falling**: higher then lower) — endpoints saved.

### DShot special commands (beacons & save)

DShot commands run only when **armed**, **motor not running**, and the command is repeated enough times (`Src/dshot.c`). Beacons 1–5 set `play_tone_flag`; actual audio plays on the next idle/low-throttle slot in `setInput` (`Src/control_loop.c`).

| DShot cmd | `play_tone_flag` | Sound | Typical use |
|-----------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | 1 | `playDefaultTone` — 2 notes rising | Beacon 1 |
| **2** | 2 | `playChangedTone` — 2 notes falling | Beacon 2 |
| **3** | 3 | `playBeaconTune3` — long descending sweep | Beacon 3 |
| **4** | 4 | `playInputTune2` — morse “R” on E6 | Beacon 4 |
| **5** | 5 | `playDefaultTone` — same as beacon 1 | Beacon 5 |
| **12** | `1 + dir_reversed` | Rising if direction normal, falling if reversed | **Save settings** confirmation |

Other DShot commands (direction, bi-dir, EDT, programming mode, etc.) do **not** play a dedicated melody unless noted above. Direction set (7/8) currently has confirmation beeps commented out in source.

### Beacon sweep detail

**`playBeaconTune3`**: stepped descending pitch with phase stepping (~10 ms steps, prescaler from high down toward lower values). Used as DShot beacon 3 and as the “entered stick calibration” cue.

### Volume and silence

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **`beep_volume` 0–11** | Duty cycle of the beep PWM (`volume * 3` compare counts). 0 is effectively silent; higher is louder (still limited so the motor barely moves). |
| Motor spinning / throttle up | Deferred tone flags wait until throttle is at idle; beeps are not mixed into normal drive. |
| No throttle signal after boot | ESC may stay in bootloader or keep waiting for input — you may only hear the **startup** tune, not the arm tune, until a valid zero throttle is seen. |

### Defined but unused

| Function | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **`playDuskingTune`** | Implemented in `sounds.c` (ascending then peaking melody) but **not called** from current application code. Kept for compatibility / possible future use. |

### Source map

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| [`Src/sounds.c`](Src/sounds.c) | All melody generators |
| [`Src/main.c`](Src/main.c) | Startup tune at boot |

## Bootloader

ARK ESCs use **[ARK32-bootloader](https://github.com/ARK-Electronics/ARK32-bootloader)** (fork of upstream [AM32-bootloader](https://github.com/am32-firmware/AM32-bootloader)). Use ARK release images for ARK hardware — not the stock upstream bootloader alone when you need ARK-specific fixes (e.g. bidirectional DShot idle detection).

| | |
|--|--|
| Source / releases | [ARK-Electronics/ARK32-bootloader](https://github.com/ARK-Electronics/ARK32-bootloader) · [releases](https://github.com/ARK-Electronics/ARK32-bootloader/releases) |
| Committed F051 image for app embed | [`Bootloaders/`](Bootloaders/) (see [Bootloaders/README.md](Bootloaders/README.md)) |
| App-side BL update | F051 builds embed the image by default (including `HWCI_PERF=1`) and rewrite the on-chip BL if it differs (`Src/bootloader_update.c`). Success soft-resets; the next boot plays **`playBootloaderUpdatedTone`** (two rising beeps) then the normal startup tune. Strip with `EMBED_BOOTLOADER=0` or `NO_EMBED_BL=1`. |

To put ARK32 on a **blank production ESC**, flash the full-chip factory image (`make factory-image` → `obj/*factory.bin` at `0x08000000`) so bootloader, app, and EEPROM defaults land in one step — see [factory/README.md](factory/README.md). For development or field app-only updates, flash a matching **ARK32-bootloader** with ST-LINK (if needed), then the application `.bin`/`.hex` at `0x08001000` (or use a configurator / one-wire serial). Later app flashes can also carry and apply a newer BL via the embed path above.

## Hardware (typical for ARK32)

ARK work centers on **STM32F051** 4-in-1 ESCs and related F051 targets, while the tree still builds the broader AM32 MCU set above. Upstream also documents STSPIN32F0, G071, GD32E230, AT32F415/F421, and others — see their hardware notes and compatibility charts.
