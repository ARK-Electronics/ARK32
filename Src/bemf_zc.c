 * between bursts (bench: ~40% of commutations blind, phantom ~15k eRPM,
 * rotor stalled at 3 A), and the stall rail almost never fires because every
 * blind step resets INTERVAL_TIMER. Below this zero-cross count the handler
 * keeps legacy semantics (commutate once per accepted crossing, no re-arm):
 * a noise chain then dies at the 45000-tick stall rail and the poll path
 * kick-steps the rotor exactly as ark-release does. 100 matches the startup
 * self-heal window in commutate() and the "stable running" gates elsewhere;
 * zero_crosses resets on desync/stop, so every re-acquisition passes through
