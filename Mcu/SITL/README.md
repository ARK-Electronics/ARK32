# AM32 SITL (software in the loop)

Runs the AM32 firmware as a native Linux executable against a simulation
of the motor, bridge and battery, with DroneCAN input/output over
multicast UDP. This allows testing of the firmware logic (startup,
commutation, DroneCAN protocol, parameters) without ESC hardware.

## Building

```
make AM32_SITL_CAN
```

produces `obj/AM32_AM32_SITL_CAN_<version>.elf`, a normal Linux
executable. SITL is **not** part of `make all` (that target stays
cross-firmware only); use `make sitl` or the product name above.

Also note: RTC backup registers used by DroneCAN boot/FW-update handoff
persist across SITL re-execs in a sibling file `<eeprom>.rtc` next to the
eeprom backing file.

## Running

```
obj/AM32_AM32_SITL_CAN_*.elf --node-id 10 --verbose
```

Options:

- `--config FILE` JSON file with motor/battery/esc/sim properties (see
  `example.json`, all keys optional)
- `--eeprom FILE` eeprom backing file (default `am32_eeprom.bin`). A
  missing file is seeded with the AM32 configurator default settings
- `--can-uri URI` CAN interface, default `mcast:0` (group 239.65.82.N
  port 57732, wire compatible with libcanard and ArduPilot SITL). An
  optional interface may be given (`mcast:0:lo`). `none` disables CAN,
  for pure PWM/DShot testing
- `--node-id N` force the DroneCAN node ID, otherwise DNA is used
- `--input-port N` UDP port for PWM/DShot input (default 57733, 0
  disables)
- `--state-port N` UDP port for high rate simulation state streaming
  and runtime motor model loading (default 57734, 0 disables)
- `--bind-any` bind the input and state ports on all interfaces instead
  of loopback only, needed when the GUI runs on a different host. The
  ports accept unauthenticated control, so only use on trusted networks
- `--input-type N` force the eeprom INPUT_SIGNAL_TYPE setting (0=auto
  1=dshot 2=servo 5=dronecan)
- `--speedup X` simulation speed relative to wall clock, 0 = free
  running; clamped to `[0, 100]` (same as the GUI/state-port control)
- `--uid STR` string used to derive the 16 byte unique ID
- `--verbose` 1Hz state line on stderr
- `--nosleep` busy wait instead of sleeping. Uses two full CPU cores but
  avoids OS sleep/wakeup latency for the most accurate wall clock pacing

The virtual ESC can then be controlled with the DroneCAN GUI tool or
pydronecan on `mcast:0`. A test script is included:

```
python3 Mcu/SITL/sitl_can_test.py --throttle 0.5 --duration 20
```

which arms, ramps the throttle via `esc.RawCommand` and reports the
`esc.Status` telemetry (RPM, voltage, current, temperature).

Note that with no DroneCAN traffic directed at the node it will reboot
every 2 seconds from the firmware signal-timeout logic, exactly as real
hardware does. Reboots (including `RestartNode` and watchdog resets)
re-exec the process; the eeprom file persists.

Each instance holds a lock on its eeprom file: two instances sharing an
eeprom (and therefore a node ID) would interleave their DroneCAN
transfers on the bus, which shows up as erratic telemetry. To run
multiple ESCs give each its own `--eeprom` and `--node-id`.

## PWM/DShot input over UDP

The SITL listens on a UDP port (default 57733) for PWM or DShot input
frames. Each packet is one frame on the virtual signal wire, synthesized
into input-capture edge timestamps and decoded by the firmware's
unmodified `Src/signal.c`/`Src/dshot.c` logic, including input type
auto-detection, CRC checking, zero-throttle arming, DShot commands and
bidirectional DShot auto-detect (idle high line).

packet format (little endian):

| field | size | meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| magic | u16  | 0x4453 |
| type  | u8   | 0=PWM 1=DSHOT150 2=DSHOT300 3=DSHOT600 |
| len   | u8   | payload bytes after the header (4) |
| flags | u16  | bit0: line idle level (1 = idle high, bidir DShot) |
| data  | u16  | PWM pulse width in us, or the full 16 bit DShot frame |

Bidirectional DShot replies (eRPM plus extended telemetry frames) are
sent back to the most recent sender in the same format, with `data`
carrying the 16 bit GCR-decoded reply frame.

Tools in `Mcu/SITL/`:

- `sitl_gui.py` — Qt (PySide6) GUI driving both the PWM/DShot input and
  DroneCAN input with per-input enable switches (for failover testing),
  BDShot/EDT and esc.Status telemetry with rates, and an
  `INPUT_SIGNAL_TYPE` parameter panel. The simulation panel selects the
  motor model (the JSON files in `Mcu/SITL/models/`, applied to the
  running simulation over the state port; switch at zero throttle for
  clean results) and has optional high rate views, both default off:
  pyqtgraph scopes of the phase currents and the phase terminal
  voltages, each in its own window (sample period down to the 500ns
  physics step and adjustable window; the sample rate is automatically
  limited to about 200k samples/s of wall clock, so fine periods take
  effect as the speedup is lowered — the PWM dead time diode conduction
  is visible on the voltages at fine sample periods), and a motor/bridge
  animation showing rotor angle, per phase bridge modes and the
  comparator. A speedup slider (0.01x to 2x)
  changes the simulation pace at runtime, for watching the animation in
  slow motion; input frames arriving faster than the slowed simulation
  consumes them are dropped, as on a real wire. `--control-port N` accepts UI
  commands over a localhost TCP connection for scripted tests (default
  off); `--log FILE` records every UI action with timestamps and
  `--replay FILE` plays a recording back, so a failing interactive
  session can be reproduced exactly. Install the
  dependencies (PySide6, pyqtgraph, dronecan; Linux/Windows/macOS) into
  a self-contained environment with

```
python3 Mcu/SITL/make_gui_env.py
```

  which creates `Mcu/SITL/venv` and prints the interpreter to run the
  GUI with. A system python with the packages from
  `Mcu/SITL/requirements-gui.txt` installed works too. The UI backends
  live in `sitl_gui_backend.py`, UI-independent for headless tests
- `dshot_test.py` — headless scripted test (arming, throttle, EDT,
  bad-CRC injection), e.g.:

```
obj/AM32_AM32_SITL_CAN_*.elf --can-uri none --input-type 1
python3 Mcu/SITL/dshot_test.py --type dshot600 --bidir --edt --throttle 800
```

Note that the eeprom default `INPUT_SIGNAL_TYPE` is DRONECAN_IN, which
disables the PWM/DShot input interrupts at startup — set it to 0/1/2
first (via `--input-type`, the GUI parameter panel, or
`dshot_test.py --input-type`). Also be aware of the current firmware
input arbitration: once any `esc.RawCommand` has been received, the 1kHz
DroneCAN input keep-alive overrides the `dshot`/`inputSet` flags and
PWM/DShot input is dead until a reboot (signal timeout after the CAN
stream stops) followed by zero-throttle re-arming. Running both inputs
at once exercises exactly this behaviour, which is what the input
priority/failover parameter work is developing against.

## macOS

Builds and runs natively (Apple Silicon or Intel) with the stock Xcode
command line tools: `make AM32_SITL_CAN`. The GUI bootstrap is the same
`python3 Mcu/SITL/make_gui_env.py`. Multicast CAN over loopback works
without configuration.

## Windows

The SITL builds under Cygwin (packages: gcc-core, make) with the same
`make AM32_SITL_CAN`, producing a native console executable, and the
POSIX signal based scheduler runs correctly under the Cygwin runtime.
The GUI uses a normal Windows python: `py Mcu/SITL/make_gui_env.py`
creates the environment and prints the interpreter to use; after that
`sitl_gui.bat` in the repository root launches the GUI (double click or
from cmd, extra arguments are passed through). Notes:

- to run the binary from outside a Cygwin shell (cmd, double click),
  copy `C:\cygwin64\bin\cygwin1.dll` next to it - its only Cygwin
  dependency (the CI artifact ships it bundled).
- Windows Firewall must allow inbound UDP for the SITL binary (or ports
  57732-57734) for CAN and the input/state ports to receive.
- the default ports (57732-57734) are in the Windows dynamic port range
  (49152-65535). If Hyper-V, WSL2 or Docker Desktop is enabled, Windows
  reserves blocks of that range at boot and `bind()` inside a reserved
  block fails with `Permission denied` (`SITL: input bind` /
  `SITL: state bind` at startup). Check with
  `netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=udp` and pass
  ports below 49152 - e.g. `--input-port 17733 --state-port 17734`, with
  the GUI's matching `--port` / `--state-port`. CI's Windows smoke test
  uses the 1773x ports for this reason. The CAN multicast port (57732)
  is fixed for wire compatibility with libcanard / ArduPilot SITL and
  cannot be moved; if that one lands in a reserved block, either free
  the range (`net stop winnat`, restart, `net start winnat`) or run with
  `--can-uri none`.
- a socket never receives its own multicast on Windows, so the CAN TX
  self test is skipped there; on a machine with several interfaces pass
  an explicit one as `--can-uri mcast:0:<ip>`.

## Headless / CI use

Everything runs without a display: the SITL is a plain console binary
and the GUI works under Qt's offscreen platform
(`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`) driven through `--control-port`, so full
interactive scenarios can run in CI. On a minimal Debian/Ubuntu the
requirements are:

```
apt install gcc make python3 python3-venv \
    libgl1 libegl1 libfontconfig1 libxkbcommon0
python3 -m venv sitl-venv && sitl-venv/bin/pip install -r Mcu/SITL/requirements-ci.txt
python3 Mcu/SITL/make_gui_env.py   # for GUI-driven tests
```

Build and run the pytest suite (boot, DShot/BDShot/EDT, PWM, DroneCAN
throttle + arming, parameter GetSet/save, motor model load):

```
make AM32_SITL_CAN
sitl-venv/bin/python Mcu/SITL/run_ci_tests.py
# or: sitl-venv/bin/pytest Mcu/SITL/tests -v --sitl obj/AM32_AM32_SITL_CAN_*.elf
```

`run_ci_tests.py` prefers pytest; pass `--legacy` for the smaller
stdlib-only smoke suite. The GitHub Actions workflow
`.github/workflows/SITL.yml` runs this on every push/PR to `main` and
`ark-release` (plus a GUI offscreen job and a Windows build/smoke job).

Multicast CAN over loopback works on a stock VM with no route
configuration (the SITL self-tests its TX at startup). Timing notes for
slow or virtualised runners: the simulation paces itself and reports
the achieved ratio in `--verbose` (x1.00 = real time); the python test
senders keep their average frame rate under coarse sleep granularity by
sending catch-up bursts, which matters because the firmware's
bidirectional DShot auto-detect needs more than 100 frames before
zero-throttle arming completes, putting a floor of roughly 100Hz on the
usable frame rate.

## Architecture

The firmware runs unmodified (built as `am32_main()`) in one thread. A
simulation thread owns simulated time, advancing it in fixed physics
steps (500ns default) and delivering emulated interrupts (BEMF
comparator, commutation timer, 20kHz loop timer, CAN RX) by suspending
the firmware thread with a signal and running the handler, reproducing
the run-to-completion interrupt semantics of the real MCU. Simulated
time is decoupled from wall time and paced to `--speedup`.

The emulated MCU follows the G431 target: TIM1 PWM generation with
preloaded ARR/CCR, a 2MHz interval timer, one-shot commutation timer,
20kHz loop timer and 1MHz utility timer, plus comparator/EXTI blanking
behaviour matching `Mcu/g431`. Timer reads from interrupt context step
the physics, so `delayMicros()` inside handlers and the comparator
filter loop behave as on hardware.

The motor model (`sim/motor.c`) is a trapezoidal back-EMF BLDC model
based on open-bldc-csim: per-phase currents, solved star point voltage
(so the floating phase terminal voltage and its zero crossings are
physical), fet Rds_on, body diode clamping of a floating phase carrying
current, and battery voltage sag from internal resistance. The
comparator compares the floating phase against the virtual neutral with
configurable noise and hysteresis, so the firmware's blanking and
filtering logic is genuinely exercised at PWM switching level.
